If you roll high, you have an uneventful travel day. On the other hand, a low roll could lead to a bandit attack or rock slide. Depending on the calamity you face, you could lose a portion of your cash, some of your inventory, or delay you for several days.

The fee for each loan is added to the principle from the start, so you can take as long as you like to pay it back. However, you can't take out another loan until this one is paid back, and all loans count against your net wealth. At the end of your limited time on the Spice Road, you want enough net wealth to retire comfortably, and you can't do that with a bunch of outstanding loans.",
