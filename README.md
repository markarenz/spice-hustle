# Spice Hustle

- Spice Hustle is a simple commodity trading game built with Typescript and ReactJS.
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- The source code for this project can be found on the project's [GitHub](https://github.com/markarenz/spice-hustle).

## Notes

- We are using `baseUrl` in the `.tsconfig` file to allow absolute import paths. Aliasing is not fully supported with CRA TS projects currently. Ideally, we would use an `@` to represent the `src` directory for absolute imports to prevent confusion with imported libraries. However, this solution works well for local build and is the one the TS docs indicate is the paved road for this use case.
